In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.", is_public: true},

Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references.", is_public: true},

An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.", is_public: true},

A heap can be classified further as either a 'max heap' or a 'min heap'. In a max heap, the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node.", is_public: true},

A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a triple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set.[1] Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well", is_public: true},

False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not - in other words, a query returns either 'possibly in set' or 'definitely not in set'. Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a 'counting' filter); the more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives.", is_public: true},
